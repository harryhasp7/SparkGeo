The script called "createFIlesScript.sh" in this file creates smaller files from another one and executes with them our experiments in cluster

1. The file from the one that the script will create the smaller files, is the "all_nodes" from Spatial Hadoop datasets

2. Save the file "all_nodes" in the same directory with this script

3. Run the script

4. The script will generate 4 new files in the same directory with all the previous by names:
	a. 020all_nodes
	b. 040all_nodes
	c. 060all_nodes
	d. 080all_nodes

5. The numbers in front of the files represent the persentage of the original one. These are the files that will be the input to the experiments

6. The script also will run for each of these files with all the memory budgets for each method. That means in total 4 * 4 * 3 = 48 runs.

7. The script will generate a file named "outDifInputSizes" which will contain all the results
